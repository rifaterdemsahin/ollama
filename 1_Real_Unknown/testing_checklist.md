# 🧪 Testing Checklist — Stage 1: Real Unknown

> **YouTube Reference:** [How to Write Effective OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+write+effective+OKRs) — Understanding objectives and key results for technical projects.

## ✅ OKR Validation Checklist

### Objective 1: Master Local LLM Deployment

- [ ] Problem statement clearly defined
- [ ] All three key results are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria documented (RAM usage, model count, platforms)
- [ ] Baseline metrics established before optimization

### Objective 2: Develop Practical Applications

- [ ] 5 API use cases identified and documented
- [ ] Custom model integration scoped
- [ ] Documentation templates created for each example

### Objective 3: Optimize Performance

- [ ] Performance measurement methodology defined
- [ ] Memory profiling tools selected
- [ ] Response time benchmarks established (target: <2s)

## ✅ Stage 1 Completion Criteria

- [ ] OKR document reviewed and approved
- [ ] Core questions answered at a conceptual level
- [ ] Timeline agreed with quarterly milestones
- [ ] Journey flows defined (Real → Environment → Simulation → Formula → Symbols → Semblance → Testing)
- [ ] Stakeholders identified
- [ ] This checklist itself links back to every objective
